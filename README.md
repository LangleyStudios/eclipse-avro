Eclipse - Avro Tooling
============

The purpose of this repository is to provide the capability to store EMF data files in the Apache Avro format.  The Acceleo project is used to generate an Avro Schema based on a given EMF schema along with an AvroResourceImpl that can be used in the place of the XMIResourceImple to load and save data using the common EMF methodology.
